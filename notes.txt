lab 4 notes

- why do we want to send data from one processor to the next?

- switch traversal (ST) is the the 5x5 crossbar, largest area consuming component in router
- might also be the critical path
- long wires, delay
- spanning out to 5 mux, so high cap
- need driver circuit

- double pumped cross bar drives signals on both clock cycles

- how many tiles in a 1mm by 1mm chip? much smaller than slide 35
